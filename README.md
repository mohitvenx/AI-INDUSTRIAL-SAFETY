# AI-INDUSTRIAL-SAFETY


A technique for locating potential environmental and safety dangers in an
organization and reducing their effects is called EHS (Environmental Health and
Safety) risk management. It is a method of foreseeing risky situations and
making preparations for them before they endanger people or property. AI offers
opportunities to corporations, society, and governments in addition to people.
The use of artificial intelligence (AI), which is revolutionizing every aspect of
every sector as it develops quickly, is enabling fierce market competition.
Artificial intelligence-based modern technologies are having a significant impact
on workplace productivity and safety.

Globally, businesses are working hard to enhance their performance in terms of
environmental, health, safety, sustainability, and accurate data management. AI
can be used in the business model used by the railroad sector today to enhance
employee safety and working conditions.

If the workers do not wear safety helmets and reflective vests during operation,
they may be hit by objects falling from above or hurt their head by falling from
a height. Therefore, a safety helmet donned with a reflective vest is the safety 
guarantee for workers in the heavy-duty industry. 

In this regard, we have developed a deep learning-based method for the real-time
detection of a safety helmet and vests at the industrial site. The model is
powered by a website (run on a localhost here), which lets the user/supervisor
observe any given workspaces with three options- detection of safety helmet
only, detection of reflective vests only, detection of both helmets and
vests simultaneously. We have proposed three different detection options in
order to provide flexibility to the company in setting their permissible norms.

In railway yards and manufacturing stations, a surveillance camera is installed in a fixed location. 
So, the view of the camera is fixed which can make sure that the background cannot change in frames. 
Considering this characteristic feature, we intend to bank on the YOLO modeling algorithm. 
Moreover, this method is found to be fast and effective to determine and segment objects in motion. 
Incase of absence of required safety gear, safety manager is notified via alarm and image through the web application developed.

The solution was developed and presented at The WABTEC EXCEED 2.0 Challenge by Team PASTRA of PES UNIVERSITY consisting of
